    I actually watch a lot of Cartoons mainly because I think its comedic. Gilmore Girls I love because I feel like it's my comfort show.</h2>
      <ol>
      <h3>
        <li> Gilmore Girls: best romantic comedy show to be presented of the time. </li>
        <li> South Park: I think its really funny plus its a crazy small town. </li>
        <li> Family Guy: Stewie is the main character of this show and I stand by that. </li>
        <li> American Dad: Rodger radiates the same vibes all the time, and love them for that. </li>
        <li> The Carrie Diaries: CARRIE IS THE BEST ULTIMATE GODDESS.</li>
      </h3>
